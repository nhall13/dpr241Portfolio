            <h3>Complete</h3>
            <p>This project involved learning how to create a portfolio homepage 
                using media queries to adjust to different screen sizes such as mobile, 
                tablet and desktop displays. While doing this project, I was familiar with 
                creating web pages using html code and css but using media queries on the 
                css style sheet was new to me. So, it was challenging at first but I 
                caught on fairly quickly as I practiced more with the queries.</p>

            <h3> <a href="Skeletonproject/index.html">Project 4 Resume Using Skeleton</a></h3>
            <h3>Complete</h3>
            <p> This project involved using my existing resume and incorporating it 
                into the Skeleton CSS responsive boilerplate. I was able to achieve this 
                project with ease using the techniques that I learned in the previous project. 
                Also, the boilerplate that I downloaded had the majority of the basic Skeleton 
                and responsive code for the columns as well as adjusting to display for 
                different screen sizes. Thus making it convenient to add additional html and 
                css code. </p>
        </div>
        <img src="PortProjFiles/images/flexbox.PNG" alt="ProjectHouse5">
        <div class="caption">
            <h3> <a href="Flexboxproject/index.html">Project 5 Flexbox</a></h3>
            <p>Complete</p>
            <p> This project involved using the flexbox frame to build the webpage. It seemed easy 
                and convenient to use. Just like the Skeleton project, there was a base html and css 
                code to build on with the option to customize. I was pleased with the outcome! </p>
        </div>
        <img src="PortProjFiles/images/bootstrap.PNG" alt="ProjectHouse5">
        <div class="caption">
            <h3> <a href="dpr241Bootstrap/index.html">Project 6 Bootstrap</a></h3>
            <p>Complete</p>
            <p> This project also involved using a frame to build the webpage. The boostrap frame 
                makes it convenient to structure a mobile website first. Since the frame already comes
                with the CSS and Javascript template, there is already a style. It seemed easy to
                use but there may be alot of work into customizing the CSS.  </p>
        </div>
        <img src="PortProjFiles/images/sass.JPEG" alt="ProjectHouse6">
        <div class="caption">
            <h3> <a href="project7sass/index.html"> Project 7 Sass</a></h3>
            <p>Complete</p>
            <p> This is another project that uses a frame to build a webpage. The Saas frame 
                can be complex being that it has its own language to convert to CSS. The saas code
                has to be inputted into an scss file in order for there to be an CSS file. From my
                perspective, the saas frame seem like it takes too many and unnecessary steps for 
                styling webpages.  </p>
        </div>
        <img src="PortProjFiles/images/project8.JPEG" alt="ProjectHouse7">
        <div class="caption">
            <h3><a href="Project8/index.html"> Project 8 Industry Exploration </a> </h3>
            <p>Complete</p>
            <p> For this project, I used the flexbox frame to build the webpage. I think this frame is  
                more convenient to use than the others. </p>

        <img src="PortProjFiles/images/project9.JPEG" alt="ProjectHouse8">

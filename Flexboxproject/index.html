  <h1>Topic: Photography</h1>


<article>I have taken a few photography classes in college such as black/white photography and digital photography. 
   These two classes taught me the fundamentals of taking clear photos which show a great amount of detail. 
   A good photographer makes sure that their camera settings are in order before shooting any scenes or people.  
   Here are some steps for basic photography: </article>

<p> - Make sure the lightening of the area is good. A well lit area such as day time light before it's too sunny or 
      a light from the ceiling area can make a difference.  Some photos may come out too dark if there isn't enough 
      light as well as some photos may come out too light or overexposed looking, if there's too much sun or light. </p>

<nav> Step 2 </nav> 
<p> - Know how to set your camera settings before shooting photos. If you are a professional photographer 
      or know what kind of photo you want, when shooting photos, you would use the manual mode to adjust 
      the shutter and aperture priority settings. Also, you can use the automatic mode on your camera, 
      if your not an experience photographer. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
<nav> Step 3 </nav>
<p> - When you are shooting the scene or person/people, a good composition and form is leveled and not slanted or crooked. 
      Note: unless your trying to achieve an slanted or crooked photo for artistic purposes! There are several ways to 
      shoot a scene such as perspective using low or high angle techniques or looking at a person/target and seeing if 
      the background should be centered around the person/target or to the right/left of person/target. </p>

<nav> Industry Exploration Technology Company </nav> 
<p> The technology company that most excites me is Adobe. Adobe is a company that 
  caters to the creation of multimedia. From graphic design to video production 
  software, Adobe is a company that seems like a fun business to work with. I enjoy 
  using their software products to create. I've used photoshop, premiere, indesign 
  and dreamweaver, to name a few of their products. </p>

  <p>Adobe has Adobe Creative Cloud which is a suite of programs that a user can create 
  an variety of multimedia art. The suite includes the CS6 Master Collection;</p>
  
  <p>Photoshop CS6 Extended, Illustrator CS6, InDesign CS6, Acrobat X Pro, 
  Flash Professional CS6, Dreamweaver CS6, Fireworks CS6, Adobe Premiere Pro CS6,
  After Effects CS6, Adobe Audition CS6, SpeedGrade CS6, Prelude CS6, Encore CS6,
  Bridge CS6, Media Encoder CS6, Flash Builder 4.6 Premium Edition and Integrates with:
  Digital Publishing Suite. </p>
  
  <p>I think the suite of programs are good but the only thing that doesn't satisfy me 
  is when Adobe change to the cloud edition. In the past, users were able to go to 
  the store and purchase the programs so that they could install and keep on their 
  computer to own, for as long as the user wants. Now, the cloud only supports 
  subscription based install, where the user doesn't own the program. The user has 
  to buy a monthly or yearly subscription in order to keep the program on their 
  computer. In my opinion, it's just a way for Adobe to earn more money. Currently, 
  I don't subscribe to the creative cloud suite but I do still own photoshop CS5 on 
  a windows laptop. If I really need to use the current version of the Adobe suite, 
  I would just subscribe to a month subscription. </p>
  
  <p>I haven't really thought about working for any big technology company. Though, I am 
  willing to work with Adobe because of their successful history with developing 
  software and programs. Adobe's initial development was their printing language 
  called postscript and it was the standard language for printing from computers. The 
  second item Adobe created was Type 1, which is a digital font. Then the first 
  multimedia software that Adobe developed was Illustrator. So, Adobe can successfully 
  develop software and programs that are original.  It would be excellent to work with 
  Adobe when they develop their next original software or program. </p>

<p> Git is a place on the internet where code can be stored and websites are hosted. 
  When I first started using Git, I thought it would be similar to the file transfer 
  portal, where you connect to a server online via the server's web address and you 
  can view the files on the local computer and server. Then you can actually see which 
  files your moving to the server by dragging them there. But Git has a different 
  process of transferring the files to GitHub and similar to using the command prompt 
  for administrative tasks and troubleshooting PCs. This process only uses text syntax 
  commands to transfer files between the GitHub server and a user's local computer. 
  I was familiar with the command prompt on a windows PC but not familiar with the 
  command prompt for mac computers, which is called the terminal when using Git. </p>

  <p>So, using the terminal to send the webpage files to GitHub wasn't that 
    confusing to me. The most challenging part to me when using Git is the learning 
    process of the language to use in the terminal. For instance, I had to get 
    familiar with the command, "git int" to first create the repository on my local 
    computer. Also, the "git commit" command to save the initial repository and save 
    changes to the repository. I had to understand that creating the repository is 
    like creating a directory to hold the web page files, in order to send the files 
    up to the GitHub hosting website.</p>
  
  <p>While learning the Git process, I was able to create six repositories: </p>
  
  <p> <img src="images/repo_screenshot.PNG" alt="Repositories"> </p>
  
  <p>The hello-world was the first repository I created as a result of the GitHub 
    introductory training. It was important to learn this first repository to 
    experience the basics for creating repositories. In GitHub, there is a way to 
    work with other users on projects. So, the two repositories', patchwork and 
    jlord/patchwork were created by the user, jlord, who is a user from the GitHub 
    training. With these repositories, I acted as a contributor for training purposes 
    by uploading test files. This process wasn't difficult because of the repository 
    already being created. I just had to download the repositories to my local 
    computer, add the file to the repository folder and then upload the repository 
    back, using the terminal and Git commands. For the github-slideshow repository, 
    I also acted as an contributor for training purposes by deploying a file. After
    learning how to create, contribute and deploy repositories, I was able to create
    my own repositorries for my portfolio homepage, dpr241Portfolio and my resume page,
    Resume using skeleton. </p>

    <p>I didn't realize, during the time of developing my portfolio, it's an excellent
      idea to include a resume on the porfolio in order to showcase a history of work 
      experience and accomplishments. Initially, while developing my porfolio, I was 
      more focused on showcasing what I'm learning, as a result of taking this mobile 
      web development class. Thus, using Git and Github in my opinion is a a good way
      for web developers to organize web projects and conveniently work in teams to 
      accomplish web projects more efficiently. </p>
